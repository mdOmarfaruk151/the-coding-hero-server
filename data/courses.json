Why not get them to learn a life long valuable skill that will lead them into a career that pays 2 times the national average?  Programming is the new math. The average computer programmer makes 78k a year and there will always be a need for programmers. The only problem is that all of the educational courses are not tailored towards the learning styles of children. Most of the documentation is geared towards people over 18.  This course shows kids how to code by adapting the material to their learning styles. There are animated lectures, informative screencasts and tests. The first portion of the course introduces a lot of data and terminology quickly. You'll jump right in. No second is wasted in this action-packed, captivating course.",

Even if the job isn't technical it always helps to have that technical knowledge to communicate with the technical team. Personally, I like to hire people with programming skills. If they are artists, video editors, or social media marketers, I generally prefer to hire people with programming experience.",

You will have a strong foundation in web development that will enable you to start creating any website you can imagine. By the end of this course, you will be competent in HTML & CSS and be able to create your own professional-grade website from scratch - no prior experience required! You will also have the skillset necessary to continue learning about web development and advancing your career. Sign up for this online course today and start building your very own websites!",
            "b":"Every webpage that you see on the internet is built using code. There are many different programming languages that can make your website do various things, but the two most important to learn are HTML and CSS. In fact, even people who plan on allowing someone else to build their website should have a basic grasp of both languages. This way you can tweak things behind the scenes, or change some of your formatting without having to always rely on others.",
            "c":"This course of more than 77 lectures and 8 hours of content gives you a basic, yet thorough understanding of both HTML and CSS. The course focuses on having you begin writing code right away so you can learn through doing, and build your own completely functional HTML and CSS webpage at the end. You'll begin by learning what HTML and CSS are, so you can get an understanding of what it is that they do. During the course you'll build several mini-websites that take what it is that you've learned and apply it to real world exercises to help cement the skills. Everyone from aspiring web designers to bloggers, programmers to business owners, company employees and tech hobbyists can benefit from learning some HTML and CSS! Learn to build your own dynamic and beautiful websites or manage the website that you already have."

This Unity course is the only one of its kind that is approved by Unity Technologies on Udemy. What better way to learn how to develop games in Unity than with their authorized course? The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity introduces you to the Unity Engine and to the fundamentals of C# programming. The course then dives into developing your first 2D and 3D games. You will discover how to set your games apart from the crowd by polishing them with Unity's latest features, including post-processing effects and the animation system.",

With Unity being the most widely used engine to develop games across multiple platforms, there has never been a better time to get into the field. As you will learn, the types of games you can create with Unity and C# are limitless. Game development makes a great hobby, allowing you to learn a new skill and play your game with family and friends. It is also an exciting and rewarding career, where plenty of successful developers, including myself, have learned the fundamentals of game development through courses like this, and not in the traditional classroom setting. Every great game starts somewhere, so why not make it yours? While people often find coding or making games intimidating, this Unity course utilizes a unique teaching method that will allow you to gain a thorough understanding of concepts while you develop your own games. Thanks to the Unity community, you'll be able to connect with other developers, work together on new projects, and make some incredible games!",
            "c":"This is the first and only Unity game development course that has been co-created with Unity Technologies on Udemy.  Because learning to code can be daunting, Unity Technologies wanted to create a course that helps new developers feel comfortable exploring the engine and developing games. I believe that the best way to learn how to code is by doing. Therefore, this is a highly interactive series that does not spoon-feed you the answers. The unique challenges integrated throughout this Unity course will ensure you not only know how to code something, but also understand the logic behind it. As a self-taught software engineer, I found that there simply weren't any high-quality video tutorials that allowed beginners to truly grasp concepts essential to game development. To remedy this, I created my own YouTube video series focused on Unity game development, where I've had the privilege of helping thousands of other people grow their passion for game development. "
